# **Snake Client Project**

Snake is a pre-existing video game whereby you play the snake and you have a simple task: eat and get big! Now I should mention, it is not a perfect life... as you eat and grow moving around the game board becomes more challenging. If you bump your head into your own massive tail due to your ever expanding waist-line üçî, or if you happen to slam into a wall, your glutteny has finished you off. Eat well and play smart my friends, but most of all, have fun being a snake! üêç

This is a stripped-down version of the game to play with and code-up as you like.

Before you can play, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install on your computer from here:

Clone from the repo:
git clone https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer.git
cd snek-multiplayer
npm install
npm run play
